# Vehicle Detection Dataset
Dataset comprises **5,000** high-resolution (≥1080p) videos of **Serbian road traffic** captured from bridge vantage points, accompanied by **annotated frame images** with JSON bounding box annotations. It is designed for research in **vehicle detection** and **classification**, focusing on analyzing **traffic flows** and **traffic density** to support** AI-driven traffic management** solutions.

By utilizing this dataset, researchers and developers can enhance their capabilities in **traffic prediction** and develop systems to optimize **road networks** and manage **daily traffic** effectively.- **[Get the data](https://unidata.pro/datasets/road-traffic-in-serbia-videos-and-images/?utm_source=github&utm_medium=referral&utm_campaign=road-traffic-in-serbia-videos-and-images)**

The dataset provides detailed visual data of vehicles (cars and minivans) in various traffic conditions, supporting the development of robust AI models for traffic monitoring and analysis.
